# User Story - Improvements and New features

![EOS User Story](./assets/user_story.png)

## Introduction

The goal of **User Story** is to design and present a scalable backend infrastructure that delivers a web interface allowing users to request new features and give feedback in an easy and intuitive way. Users can attach files with their story to explain what they want. The admins can then resolve, close and update the status of these stories. Users can interact with other stories via comments and votes. This can also serve as an efficient feedback and response mechanism which is critical for any organization to improve and make progress. Simply put, its a **product management tool**.

## My Journey

It was a great experience, contributing to an open-source project and learning something new everyday in that process. Given below you can find the blogs written by me, documenting my GSoC 2021 journey.

## Thank You!

The past 4 months have been pretty exciting, full of ups and downs. Time flew by so fast, and today here I am writing this final report. All these things would not have been possible without your support, motivation and guidance. Thank You for guiding me through this summer.
